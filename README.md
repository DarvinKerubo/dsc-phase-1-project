Business Problem
Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they don’t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create

Business Problem Understanding
I'll be looking at information from the Budget and IMDB . The following details will explore: Title, Tconst (Unique Movie Identifier), Domestic Gross, Worldwide Gross, Average Rating, Number of Votes, and the Movie Genres. For my research, I'll be concentrating on both domestic and foreign gross to get insight into both domestically and globally.

In my analysis I explored the following questions
Which types of movies and ratings that people watch?
Did multiple genres perform better than the single genres?
What is the relationship between worlwidr gross and domestic gross?
Does voting for movies increase the movie ratings?

From the visualizations to help Microsoft movie studio come up with a successful movie studio

At the beginning, Microsoft should focus on genres News, Documentary and music as they have the highest individual ratings
Microsoft should create polls where people vote for their favourite movies to increase the ratings of those movies
Microsoft should produce movies that have multiple genres instead of one because they are more succesful and have a higher rating.

Conclusion
 Conclusion
 it is crucial that Microsoft's movie studios start with genres that have strong ratings since this is a sure sign of the public's approval. In order to make the films made by Microsoft Studios more interesting, it is also crucial that each film include a diversity of genres. Prior to releasing a film globally, Microsoft Movie Studio should encourage viewers to rate their favourite movies domestically as it increases ratings. Domestic movies perform  better than worlwide movies.   The fact that certain film studios stand out because their films are well received and have better ratings is something that the Microsoft movie studio should pay attention to .
