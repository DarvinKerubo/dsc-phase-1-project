# Phase 1 Project

For this project I have used the imdb_title_basics, imdb_title_ratings and bom.movie_gross datasets. 

## Project Overview

For this project, you will use exploratory data analysis to generate insights for a business stakeholder. My objectives are:
What type of movie did people watch and rate and also the year that did well
What genre did most people watch?
What movies produced the most gross?
Is there a correlation between how long a movie is run and how it is rated?


### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they don’t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

### The Data

In the folder `zippedData` are movie datasets from:

* imdb_title_ratings
* imdb_title_basics
* bom.movie_gross

The following steps were used in the analysis
Data Extraction
Data Cleaning
Data Wrangling
Data Analysis
Steps taken:

The following unclean data was dealt with using appropriate methods

Missing Data
Wrong Data Types
Outliers and non relevant data
Duplicates
Methods applied during cleaning of this data include

Dropping missing values
Using mean to fill in missing values

Assigning appropriate data types
Dropping duplicated values and columns
Data Wrangling
In this step various methods were applied in order to make the data better for analysis and visualisation. Merging Data to form one data frame

Combining Data
Joining Data
Indexing Data
Dealing with Categorical Data
Data Analysis
Appropriate methods were applied in order to come up with various models and visualizations that will be used for coming up with appropriate actions to be undertaken by Microsoft movie studio before unveilling Seaborn was used to visualise the various statitistical visualization models Uploading image.png…


Action
Microsoft's movie studio was able to develop a number of useful ctions based on the results of the visualizations.
The success of the film studio was propelled by a number of measures, but only a select few will be discussed here. Which ones are they?


At the beginning, Microsoft should focus on genres News, Documentary and music as they have the highest individual ratings
Microsoft should produce movies that have multiple genres instead of one as they're more succesful and have a higher rating.
Summary
Data was extracted from three data sets, cleaned, and wrangled to help Microsoft's new film studio launch. After wrangling the Data was used to create various statistical models and visualizations in order to establish appropriate actions to be undertook by microsoft in their making of the movie Studio. A number of recommendations for future business steps were proposed as a result.


Conclusion
Though there is no one, definitive way to start a film production company, it is crucial that whatever steps are taken pay off financially and are well received by audiences. It therefore imporant that Microsoft movie studios start with genres that have a high rating as it is a clear indication of positive response from the audience. it is also important that the movies produced by microsoft studios should have a variety of genres per movie to ensure that these movies are more engaging Microsoft Movie Studio should also focus on intricacies such as how long the movie runs and how well it perfoms locally before it does internationally . Microsoft's film division needs to study what makes certain studios' films more accessible and popular with audiences. It's not completely out of the question to achieve success with the film studio; instead, you should concentrate on the numbers.
